# Flag Images for Language Selector

This directory should contain the following flag images:

- `italy-flag.png`: Italian flag
- `uk-flag.png`: UK flag

These images should be small (approximately 16x12px) for use in the language selector component.

You can find these flag images from various free resources or create them yourself.

Alternatively, you could use flag emoji characters (ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ and ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§) instead of images.
