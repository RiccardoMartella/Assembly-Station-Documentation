                <h3>Legal Basis for Processing</h3>
                <p>The Owner processes Personal Data relating to the User if one of the following conditions applies:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The User has given consent for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                  <li>The processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with the User and/or for pre-contractual measures.</li>
                  <li>The processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject.</li>
                  <li>The processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner.</li>
                  <li>The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or a third party.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In any case, it is always possible to request the Owner to clarify the specific legal basis for each processing and in particular to specify whether the processing is based on law, required by a contract, or necessary to conclude a contract.</p>

                <h3>Additional Information on Retention Time</h3>
                <p>Unless otherwise indicated in this document, Personal Data is processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose for which it was collected and may be retained for a longer period due to legal obligations or based on User consent.</p>
                <p>Therefore:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner and the User will be retained until such contract has been fully performed.</li>
                  <li>Personal Data collected for purposes related to the Owner's legitimate interests will be retained as long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the Owner.</li>
                  <li>When processing is based on the User's consent, the Owner may retain Personal Data for longer until that consent is revoked. Furthermore, the Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period in compliance with a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once the retention period expires, Personal Data will be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after expiration of the retention period.</p>

                <h3>User Rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3>
                <p>Users may exercise certain rights regarding their Data processed by the Owner.</p>
                <p>In particular, within the limits of the law, Users have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time.</strong> Users have the right to withdraw consent where they have previously given their consent to the processing of their Personal Data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Object to processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to object to the processing of their Data if the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent.</li>
                  <li><strong>Access their Data.</strong> Users have the right to learn if Data is being processed by the Owner, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing, and obtain a copy of the Data undergoing processing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Verify and seek rectification.</strong> Users have the right to verify the accuracy of their Data and ask for it to be updated or corrected.</li>
                  <li><strong>Restrict the processing of their Data.</strong> Users have the right to restrict the processing of their Data. In this case, the Owner will not process their Data for any purpose other than storing it.</li>
                  <li><strong>Have their Personal Data deleted or otherwise removed.</strong> Users have the right to obtain the erasure of their Data from the Owner.</li>
                  <li><strong>Receive their Data and have it transferred to another controller.</strong> Users have the right to receive their Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lodge a complaint.</strong> Users have the right to bring a claim before their competent data protection authority.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Users have the right to obtain information regarding the legal basis for the transfer of Data abroad, including to any international organization governed by public international law or established by two or more countries, such as the UN, as well as regarding the security measures taken by the Owner to protect their Data.</p>

                <h3>Details on the Right to Object</h3>
                <p>When Personal Data is processed in the public interest, in the exercise of official authority vested in the Owner, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner, Users may object to such processing by providing a ground related to their particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
                <p>Users should be aware that, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing purposes, they can object to that processing at any time, free of charge and without providing any justification. Where the User objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the Personal Data will no longer be processed for such purposes. To learn whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>

                <h3>How to Exercise Rights</h3>
                <p>Any requests to exercise User rights can be directed to the Owner through the contact details provided in this document. Requests are free of charge and will be answered by the Owner as early as possible and always within one month, providing Users with all information required by law. Any rectification, erasure, or limitation of processing will be communicated by the Owner to each recipient, if any, to whom the Personal Data has been disclosed unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. At the Users' request, the Owner will inform them about those recipients.</p>
