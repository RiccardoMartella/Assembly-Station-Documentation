                <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
                <p>This document contains information regarding the technologies that enable this Application to achieve the purposes described below. Such technologies allow the Owner to collect and save information (for example through the use of Cookies) or to use resources (for example by running a script) on the User's device when the User interacts with this Application.</p>
                <p>For simplicity, in this document such technologies are briefly defined as "Tracking Tools", unless there is a reason to differentiate.</p>
                <p>For example, while Cookies can be used in both web and mobile browsers, it would be inappropriate to talk about Cookies in the context of mobile device applications, since these are Tracking Tools that require the presence of a browser. For this reason, within this document the term Cookie is only used to specifically indicate that particular type of Tracking Tool.</p>
                <p>Some of the purposes for which Tracking Tools are used may also require the User's consent. If consent is given, it can be freely withdrawn at any time following the instructions contained in this document.</p>
                <p>This Application uses Tracking Tools managed directly by the Owner (commonly called "first-party" Tracking Tools) and Tracking Tools that enable services provided by third parties (commonly called "third-party" Tracking Tools). Unless otherwise specified within this document, such third parties have access to their respective Tracking Tools.</p>
                <p>The duration and expiration of Cookies and other similar Tracking Tools may vary depending on what is set by the Owner or each third-party provider. Some of them expire at the end of the User's browsing session.</p>
                <p>In addition to what is specified in the description of each of the categories below, Users can obtain more detailed and updated information on the duration, as well as any other relevant information - such as the presence of other Tracking Tools - in the privacy policies of the respective third-party providers (through the links provided) or by contacting the Owner.</p>

                <p>Users can use their browser settings to:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>See which Cookies or other similar technologies have been set on the device;</li>
